        </div>
        <p>A custom-built or homebuilt computer is a computer assembled from available components, usually commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, rather than purchased as a complete system from a computer system supplier, also known as pre-built systems.

Custom built or Homebuilt computer is usually considered cheaper to assemble as compared to buying a pre-built computer, since it excludes the labor associated with building a computer, and instead the labor is done by the end-user in assembling their own homebuilt computer.

Homebuilt computers are almost always used at home, like home computers, but home computers were traditionally purchased already assembled by the manufacturer. However, there were kits that were both home computers and homebuilt computers, like the Newbear 77-68, which the owner was expected to assemble and use in his or her home.</p>
